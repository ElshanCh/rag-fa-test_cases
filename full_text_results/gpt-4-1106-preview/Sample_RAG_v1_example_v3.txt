   - Expected output: The ISO message contains the new subfields with correct data types and values as per the rules specified.
   - Expected input: Transactions with processing codes 280000, 200000 (Mastercard), and 260000, 200000 (Visa).

2. **Controlli formali Autorizzativo**
   - Description: Addition of a new subfield 047.01 (Reg487 Verification Result) to the ISO message to transport the outcome of formal checks performed by Autorizzativo.
   - Goal: To ensure that the new subfield correctly reflects the result of the formal checks.
   - Expected output: The ISO message includes subfield 047.01 with values indicating the result of the checks.
   - Expected input: ISO messages 1100, 1120, 1121 with various scenarios of formal checks.

3. **Mapping Campi ISO con Tabella TR**
   - Description: Mapping of new and existing ISO message fields with the Sistema AntiFrode TR table.
   - Goal: To confirm that the mapping of ISO fields to the TR table is accurate and that new fields are correctly stored.
   - Expected output: The TR table reflects the correct mapping and storage of ISO message fields.
   - Expected input: ISO messages 1100, 1120, 1121 with the relevant fields populated.

4. **Integrazione dati Trasferimento Fondi nella GUI Sistema AntiFrode**
   - Description: Integration of new data fields related to fund transfers into the GUI of Sistema AntiFrode for rule and accumulator parameters.
   - Goal: To validate that the new data fields are available and functional in the GUI for rule setup and accumulator management.
   - Expected output: The GUI displays the new fields in the rule parameters and accumulator settings.
   - Expected input: User navigation through the GUI to set up rules and accumulators.

5. **Dettaglio Transazione Finanziaria**
   - Description: Display of additional data fields ("Sender Identification Type", "Sender Identification Value", and "Reg487 Verification Result") in the financial transaction detail page.
   - Goal: To check that the additional data fields are visible and correctly displayed in the transaction detail page.
   - Expected output: The transaction detail page shows the new data fields with accurate information.
   - Expected input: Access to the transaction detail page through the GUI.

6. **Risposte Sistema AntiFrode**
   - Description: Configuration of Sistema AntiFrode to provide specific response codes and reasons for denial related to fund transfer traceability checks.
   - Goal: To ensure that Sistema AntiFrode responds with the correct codes and reasons when a fund transfer fails traceability checks.
   - Expected output: Sistema AntiFrode issues response codes "57" or "119" and denial reason "R4 - No dati Reg847" as appropriate.
   - Expected input: Transactions that fail the traceability checks.

7. **Contesto svolgimento TEST**
   - Description: Execution of tests for each new piece of information in the specified functional areas and in the following order: GUI Web setup, ON-LINE messages, and GUI Web inquiry.
   - Goal: To comprehensively test the new functionalities in the specified order and ensure they work as expected.
   - Expected output: Successful setup and inquiry in the GUI Web and correct processing of ON-LINE messages.
   - Expected input: Test cases covering all new information and functionalities in the specified areas.

Please note that the expected inputs and outputs are based on the provided documentation and the actual values may vary depending on the specific implementation details.
